## International Speakers

The twenty speakers of the conference have varying backgrounds and our roster includes many of the leading names from the community. The single track format allows our visitors to get most out of the experience. In particular, we want to connect the speakers with the local community as well as possible.

## Focused Audience

We expect the audience to contain plenty of international flavor. Our target is to reach between 300 and 400 attendees. Usually 20-30% of our attendees are from abroad.

## National and International Visibility

The conference will have visibility both in national and international level and will reach the ecosystem in React and React Native widely. It has been positioned as a developers to developers conference but we are willing to provide visibility to limited amount of companies in order to produce the highest quality conference we can. We see sponsorships as value add and believe good collaborations can improve the experience for everyone involved.

## Your Spot to Shine

We are offering the perfect spot for companies to promote their knowledge and presence in the React ecosystem through sponsorships. In addition, there will be also side activities with speakers and organizers to connect and communicate with top level professionals.
