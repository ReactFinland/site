    "description":
      "Managing the many user interface states of an application easily becomes complicated. We'll discover how some historical and important computer science concepts – state machines and statecharts – and a functional + reactive approach can make it much easier to understand, visualize, implement, and automatically create tests for complex user interfaces and flows.\n\nThe topic is discussed in greater detail in a workshop!"
