The event is run by the non-profit *React Finland ry* organization – by developers, for developers. We have seen our share of better and worse events and will put the experience gained towards building the best conference we can organize.

Our goal is to connect our valued speakers with our local community in the most fruitful way we can and provide Finnish hospitality to our conference visitors. We hope to create something unique by combining our northern traditions with speakers and visitors from all around the world.
