## Learn More about React, Explore Finland

![React Finland logo|200|200|react-image](assets/img/logo.png)

**React Finland** combines the Finnish React community with international flavor. The first of its kind in Finland, the event consists of a workshop day and two days of presentations around the topic.

In this single track event you will learn more about React and surrounding topics while meeting some of the leading talents of the community.

The event will be held between 24th and 26th of April 2018 in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. In addition to enjoying the event, this is your chance to explore Finland.

T> If there's enough demand, we'll organize a guided tour that helps you understand this mysterious country not many seem to know a lot about. You might have heard of Nokia or Linux but there's more to the country than that.

## Schedule

The schedule of the event has been carefully curated. In true Finnish style, we rather focus on quality than quantity. There is no call for papers and the speakers have been chosen with care.

### 24.04 - Tuesday - [Workshops](/workshops/)

So far, the following workshops have been confirmed. Each session will take four hours and they are arranged twice so you have a chance to choose two. A session is capped to twenty people.

* **Babel** – Learn Babel thoroughly with Sven Sauleau, a core developer.
* **Reactive State Machines** - Learn how to refactor an old application to use state machines with David Khourshid.
* **ReasonML** – See the reason in ReasonML with Nik Graf and Patrick Stapfer.

### 25.04 - Wednesday - React

In Finnish style, we start each day early. We also eat lunch early. This way we'll have time to visit sauna, the holiest place of our culture.

The first presentation day has a strict focus on React itself. Each session ends with a brief break and we have a couple longer breaks in between:
