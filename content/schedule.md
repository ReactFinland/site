The schedule of the event has been carefully curated. In true Finnish style, we rather focus on quality than quantity. There is no call for papers and the speakers have been chosen with care.

### 24.04 - Tuesday - [Workshops](/workshops/)

Each session will take four hours and they are arranged twice so you have a chance to choose two. A session is capped to twenty people.

* **Babel** – Learn Babel thoroughly with Sven Sauleau, a core developer.
* **Reactive State Machines** - Learn how to refactor an old application to use state machines with David Khourshid.
* **ReasonML** – See the reason in ReasonML with Nik Graf and Patrick Stapfer.

The following four hour workshops are arranged only once:

We also have a full day workshop (eight hours including a lunch):

### 25.04 - Wednesday - React

In Finnish style, we start each day early. We also eat lunch early. This way we'll have time to visit sauna, the holiest place of our culture.

The first presentation day has a strict focus on React itself. Each session ends with a brief break and we have a couple longer breaks in between:
