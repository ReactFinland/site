## Learn More about React, Explore Finland

**React Finland** combines the Finnish React community with international flavor. First of its kind in Finland, the event consists of a workshop day and two days of presentations around the topic. In this single track event you will learn more about React and surrounding topics while meeting some of the leading talents of the community.

The event will be held between 24th and 26th of April (2018) in Helsinki. In addition to enjoying the event, this is your chance to explore Finland.

T> If there's enough demand, we'll organize a guided tour that helps you understand this mysterious country not many seems to know a lot about. You might have heard of Nokia or Linux but there's more to the country than that.

## Program

The program of the event has been carefully curated. In Finnish style, we rather focus on quality than quantity. There is no call for papers and the speakers have been chosen with care.

### Christian Alfoni - Declarative state and side effects

Writing declarative code for our UIs is so common that we do not even think about it.

We are going to talk about how we can get help writing our business logic in a declarative manner and see what benefits it gives us.

### [Gant Laborde](http://gantlaborde.com/) - React Native Ignite

Life can be simple again. Haven’t we built the same house, or given the same hair cut over and over? 80% of mobile app development is the same old song. So why is mobile so difficult/expensive? It’s not with React Native.

Let's look at how simple it is to get started in React Native using Ignite CLI.  Using Ignite, you can jump in with a popular combination of technologies, OR brew your own. Ignite is the freedom to learn and automate your mobile app.

### Sia Karamalegos - Universal React Apps Using Next.js

Every user’s hardware is different, and processing speed can hinder user experience on client-side rendered React applications. Server-side rendering and code-splitting can drastically improve user experience by minimizing the work that the client has to do.

It’s easy to get lost in the lingo, so come learn what it all means and how to easily build universal React apps using the Next.js framework. We’ll walk through the concepts and use code examples to cement your understanding. You’ll get the most out of this session if you’re comfortable with React and ES6 syntax.
